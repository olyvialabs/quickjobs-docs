# Delete a company profile

Deleting a company that no longer has vacancies available can be beneficial in maintaining a more organized and updated list of companies. Keeping an updated list of companies can be important to ensure that job postings are not sent to companies that are no longer in business, for example. In addition, deleting a company that no longer has vacancies available can also make it easier to quickly find companies that are actively looking for new employees.

## Desktop

To delete a company first make sure you are logged in, then go to <span style={{color : '#f97316'}}>**Profile**</span>.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/manage-personal-data/profile-setting-desktop-en.png" width="300" />
</p>


On the QuickJobs profile page, you will find the **Profile you manage** section at the bottom. From here, you can click on the three dots located in the upper right corner of each company and then click on <span style={{color : '#f97316'}}>**Delete**</span>.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/delete-company/delete-submenu-desktop-en.png" width="90%" />
</p>

When you click on the delete button, a message will appear to make sure that you really want to delete the company. If you're sure, go ahead and confirm it, and the company will be deleted without a trace. Beware! It's like pressing the self-destruct button, so make sure it's really what you want! ðŸ«£.
