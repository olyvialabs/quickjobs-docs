# Share vacancy

If you know someone who could be the ideal candidate for a job opening, sharing the opportunity with them can make a difference! Moreover, helping your friends or acquaintances to find a job that fits their skills and experiences can be a great way to show support and strengthen their professional network.

Sharing a job opening is very easy, you just need to search for the job in the job explorer, and in the job card you will find the <span style={{color : '#f97316'}}>**Share**</span> button. By clicking on this button, several options will be displayed to share the job on different social media platforms, or you can click on the "Copy Link" button to copy the job link. That's it, it's that simple!
