# Apply for a job vacancy

There are two ways to browse vacancies on our menu. The first is by browsing through the vacancies that appear on the home screen. To access the details of a vacancy, simply click on it. The second way is through the "swipe" mode similar to dating apps, where you can quickly apply to vacancies by swiping the cards. Below, I will explain both ways so you can choose the one that best suits your needs.

## Explore mode

On the home screen of the application, you will find the "Explore" section where you can browse through all available job vacancies. If you click on a job, you will be able to view all the details and requirements, including the job description, salary, location, and more. This window allows you to quickly and easily explore all job vacancies and find those that are of interest to you. Additionally, if you want to make a customized search, I'll explain it to you here: [Search filters](../Vacancy%20application/search).

</p>

Once you access the detailed information of a job vacancy and if you are interested, you can click on "Apply for job". Immediately, a short [poll](../Vacancy%20application/poll) with simple questions will appear. Once you answer the questions, just click on "Submit application" and the process will be completed.

After answering the poll you will see this success message.

## Swipe mode

At Quickjobs, we offer a card-swiping exploration mode similar to the "swipe" feature in dating apps. If you're interested in a vacancy, simply swipe the card to the right to access the application process. If you're not interested, swipe the card to the left to reject the vacancy. This feature allows you to quickly browse through all available job vacancies and select the ones that interest you the most.

To access the swipe mode, click on the icon located in the top right corner.

In addition, there are three buttons located at the bottom of each card: the upward pointing hand button is to apply for the vacancy, the "x" button is to reject it, and the middle button is to share the vacancy with a friend.
