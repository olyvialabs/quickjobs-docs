# Likes

In Quickjobs, we offer a system of likes that allows you to save your favorite job vacancies on a special page so you can easily access them in the future. When you find a job vacancy you like, simply click on the "like" button located on the vacancy card. This action will automatically add the job vacancy to your favorites list, allowing you to save and review it later. It's an easy and practical way to keep track of the job vacancies that interest you the most and to stay on top of those you wish to apply to in the near future.
