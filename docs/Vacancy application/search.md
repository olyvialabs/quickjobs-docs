# Search filter

Our advanced filter search engine allows you to find job opportunities that match your skills and preferences. With just a few clicks, you can filter job postings by location, salary, job type, and much more. Our search engine makes finding your ideal job quick and easy!

To use our search engine, simply click on the magnifying glass icon in the navigation bar! This will open the search bar at the top of the screen, where you can enter keywords related to the profession you are looking for, such as job title, company name or any specific job feature.

A modal will open with all the search tools. In this mode, you can find a search bar to search for keywords, as well as the option to select the payment mode that best suits your needs. In the job scheme section, you can filter by the type of job you are looking for, whether it be full-time, contractor, part-time, intern, etc. You can also define an expected salary range and the publication date of the vacancy.

Another interesting search tool is the category, where you can select one of the available categories and subsequently a subcategory to facilitate your search and find your ideal job.

To start your search, simply click on the <span style={{color : '#f97316'}}>**Apply filters**</span>.
