# Manage my applications

In Quickjobs, we have a section called "Manage Applications" that allows you to keep a record of all the applications you have sent for the job openings that interest you. In this section, you can view the status of your applications, as well as receive notifications of any updates to the status of your applications. In summary, this section will help you keep better track of your job applications and stay organized during your job search on Quickjobs.

To access this section, simply click on the following icon located on the navigation bar.

In this section, your job applications are classified as <span style={{color : '#f97316'}}>**In progress**</span> and <span style={{color : '#f97316'}}>**Acepted**</span>.

The user can preview the vacancies they have applied to, and they can also click on the three dots which display two options: to view the answers they provided in the questionnaire or to report the vacancy.
