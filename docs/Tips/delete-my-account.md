# I found a job, should I delete my QuickJobs profile?

Not necessarily. Even if you have found a job, it is recommended that you keep your information updated on QuickJobs. This can be useful in the future if you decide to search for another job, as companies can view your profile and directly contact you if they consider you to be a good candidate.

Additionally, keeping your profile updated will help you have a better position in QuickJobs job searches, increasing your chances of being contacted by companies in the future.

Therefore, it is not necessary to unsubscribe from QuickJobs once you have found a job. Simply update your profile with your new job situation and keep your information updated to always be visible and available for future job opportunities.
