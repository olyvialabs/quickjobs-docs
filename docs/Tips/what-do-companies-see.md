# What do companies see on my QuickJobs profile?

In the digital age, it is becoming increasingly common to be concerned about the privacy of our personal data. At QuickJobs, we understand the importance of protecting your data and take the confidentiality of the information you share on our platform very seriously.

On QuickJobs, companies can see all the information you provided in your profile, such as your location, name, website, description, profile picture, and skills. It is important to note that this information can be used by companies to decide whether or not to contact you for a job vacancy. However, it's important to mention that companies cannot see which other job vacancies you have applied to.

In summary, at QuickJobs, we work to ensure the privacy and security of your personal data and only share the necessary information for companies to make an informed decision about your profile.
